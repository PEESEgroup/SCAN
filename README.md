# AI for Non-aqueous Electrolyte Design
This software package implements the SCAN (Shaping Conductivity Atlas for Non-aqueous electrolytes) that takes Li-salts, solvents, and conditions to predict the ionic conductivity.

The package provides two major functions:

Train a SCAN model with the entire data
